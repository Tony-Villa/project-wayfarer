# User Flow

## Not Logged In

When a not logged in user visits Project Wayfarer they will be greated with a fun splash screen.

Under the splash screen the users will see a short about section so they can learn more about Project Wayfarer as well as a route to log in or sign up.

## Logged In

After a user has logged in, they will be greeted with a select collection of cities that they can browse through.

## Cities

The user will be able to select a city and be directed into the City Show Page. In the City Show Page, the user will see more details about the selected city. Below that, the user will be able to see various blog posts. They will also see a button to add a post.

## Blog

### Viewing Blog:

Upon clicking on a blog post, the user will read about another user's experience traveling to that city. These posts are meant to be longer form reviews of cities that will give readers an idea of traveling there. This will serve as a sort of review (including a rating system) for others to use as a guide.

### Creating Blog:

When creating a blog post, the user will be greeted with a form that will ask for the title of the post, an optional field for an image, and a larger text field for the user to be able to write the content of their post.
